### Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Prediction for FLO 🛍️✨
Hi LinkedIn Family! 👋
I’m excited to share my latest data analytics project: predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) for FLO, a major retailer! 🚀 This project showcases how businesses can use data-driven insights to optimize customer retention and maximize revenue.

**💡 Project Highlights**
Here’s what I’ve accomplished in this project:

Identified FLO’s most valuable customers and their expected future purchases.
Forecasted total company sales over the next 3 months.
Created actionable customer segments for marketing and retention strategies.

**📊 Data and Tools**
Dataset: Transactional data from FLO’s customer purchases.

**Tech Stack:**

🐍 Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, lifetimes)
📈 CLTV Modeling using BG/NBD and Gamma-Gamma Models.
Visualizations to communicate insights effectively.

**🧠 Methodology**
Data Cleaning:

Removed invalid entries (e.g., missing Customer ID, canceled invoices).
Filtered for customers with repeat purchases (frequency > 1).
CLTV Metrics Calculation:

Recency: 

Time since the last purchase (in weeks).
T (Customer Age): Time since the first purchase (in weeks).
Frequency: Number of repeat purchases.
Monetary Value: Average revenue per purchase.

Modeling:

BG/NBD Model: Predicted how often customers will make purchases.
Gamma-Gamma Model: Predicted average revenue per customer.

Forecasting:

Estimated customer-level and company-wide expected sales for the next 1 and 3 months.
Ranked top customers based on their predicted purchases and revenue contribution.


**🔍 Key Findings**


Top 10 Customers:
These are the most valuable customers expected to make the highest number of purchases next month. FLO can focus retention and upselling efforts on these customers! 🎯

Company-Wide Insights:
Predicted [X] purchases for FLO in the next 3 months, helping to inform sales and inventory planning.

Customer Segmentation:

**🌟 Why It Matters**


This project demonstrates how advanced analytics can:

Drive strategic decision-making.
Improve marketing ROI by focusing on high-value customers.
Forecast sales trends with confidence.

**🔧 How I Solved It**


I used statistical models to predict customer behavior and combined this with visual storytelling to convey actionable insights. Every step, from data cleaning to final forecasting, was completed with precision and attention to detail. 🧹📈

**🥳 A Big Smile! 😊**


This was not just a technical challenge but also an opportunity to contribute to FLO’s growth with insights that can shape real-world decisions.
